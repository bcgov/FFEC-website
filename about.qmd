The Future Forest Ecosystems Centre is a brand new research-oriented
team at the Forest Carbon and Climate Services Branch of the Office of
the Chief Forester (BC Ministry of Forests).

Started in 2022, the FFEC has put together a team of researchers to
answer complex questions about the stability and resilience for British
Columbia's forests to the effects of ongoing climate change, drought,
pests and fire.

To answer these complex questions, we use a using a variety of
approaches from advanced statistical modelling to downscale climate
projections and complex ecological landscape simulation modelling, to
collecting and analysing dendrochronological data to investigate tree
and stand responses to climate warming and drought.
