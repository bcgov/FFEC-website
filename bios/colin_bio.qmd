Colin has a 25 year career in forestry and climate change adaptation. He
started as a consultant in the areas of basic silviculture, timber
supply analysis, restoration of forests disturbed by mountain pine
beetle, wildfire hazard reduction around communities, and ecosystem
mapping. Motivated by climate change impacts he witnessed in the field,
Colin left consulting in 2013 to pursue a PhD in ecological climatology
with Prof. Sally Aitken at UBC Forestry, focusing on the emergence of
novel climate types in BC. He joined the BC Government in 2020 as
Research Climatologist in the Office of the Chief Forester. As Team
Lead, Colin coordinates the operations and strategic direction of the
FFEC, and contributes to the development of decision support tools.
Colin lives in Victoria with his wife and two kids.
