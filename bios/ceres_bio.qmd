Ceres has a strong passion for understanding and predicting ecosystem
resilience to multiple disturbances. She has experience using complex
ecological simulation models to explore fundamental and applied
questions related to ecosystem stability to climate change, drought,
fire, land-use changes and permafrost thaw. Her research is also
strongly focused on the development of integrated, reusable and
transparent modelling workflows that can be used not only for research
purposes, but also to support and inform end-users within and beyond
government. 

She earned her BSc in Biology from the University of Lisbon,
Portugal, and an MSc in Ecology and Environmental Sustainability from
the University of Aberdeen, Scotland. She later obtained her PhD in
Biodiversity, Ecology and Environment from the University of Grenoble
Alps, France, and was a post-doctoral fellow and research associate at
the the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada.

After spending some time as Climate Change Research Ecologist at the FFEC,
Ceres took a Research Scientist position at the Pacific Forestry Centre, 
Canadian Forest Service. She is an Adjunct Professor at the University of 
British Columbia and at Universit√© Laval, is on the 
[British Ecological Society Macroecology SIG](https://www.britishecologicalsociety.org/membership-community/special-interest-groups/macroecology/) 
committee and on the 
[Response Diversity Network](https://responsediversitynetwork.github.io/RDN-website/who-we-are.html)
committee, and is an Associate Editor for [Ecological Solutions and
Evidence](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/26888319).
