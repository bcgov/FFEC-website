Vanessa Comeau uses forest ecology and dendrochronology to better
understand the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on forests in
British Columbia. She is particularly interested in applied research
that is collaborative with local stakeholders and Indigenous Peoples.
Vanessa earned an MSc from the Faculty of Forestry at the University of
British Columbia focused on understanding the climatic drivers of
yellow-cedar decline on Haida Gwaii.

She completed a Bachelor of Environmental Science at the University of
Manitoba with a focus on vegetation ecology and anthropogenic impacts on
prairie ecosystems. Vanessa grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba and has lived
in BC since 2016. She currently lives and works on the unceded ancestral
territory of the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh peoples
(Vancouver, BC).
