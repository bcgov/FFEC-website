Colin has a 25 year career in forestry and climate change adaptation. He started as a consultant 
in the areas of basic silviculture, timber supply analysis, restoration of forests disturbed by 
mountain pine beetle, wildfire hazard reduction around communities, and ecosystem mapping. 
Motivated by climate change impacts he witnessed in the field, Colin left consulting in 2013 to 
pursue a PhD in ecological climatology with Prof. Sally Aitken at UBC Forestry, focusing on the 
emergence of novel climate types in BC. He joined the BC Government in 2020 as Research 
Climatologist in the Office of the Chief Forester. As Team Lead, Colin coordinates the 
operations and strategic direction of the FFEC, and contributes to the development of decision 
support tools. Colin lives in Victoria with his wife and two kids.
