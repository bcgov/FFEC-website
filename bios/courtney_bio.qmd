Courtney is a plant community ecologist and biogeographer, with a
motivation for understanding the myriad drivers of species range
dynamics and their responses to global change. She has expertise in
alpine tundra ecosystems and is excited to be transitioning to a focus
on the beautiful forest ecosystems of British Columbia. Much of her
research focuses on the combination of biotic and abiotic drivers that
shape species responses to the environment, including competitive
dynamics, plant-soil interactions, and plant phenology and functional
traits. Courtney has a passion for data science and ecological modeling
and loves employing a diverse set of statical modeling frameworks to
address challenging ecological questions.

She completed an M.S. at the University of Georgia in Conservation
Ecology and a PhD at UC Riverside in Plant Biology. She then worked as a
Postdoctoral researcher at CU Boulder and at the Biodiversity Research
Centre at UBC. Courtney is an avid hiker, camper, and overall nature
enthusiast, and loves spending time outdoors identifying plants,
mushrooms, and wildlife across BC and beyond!
