Welcome to the Future Forest Ecosystems Centre!

We are a research-oriented team based at the Forest Carbon and Climate Services Branch,
Office of the Chief Forester (BC Ministry of Forests), in Victoria, BC, Canada.

The Future Forest Ecosystems Centre (FFEC) supports the integration of climate 
risk into ecosystem management in British Columbia. We are a scientific team that
forecasts climate change impacts to BCâ€™s forest ecosystems. 

Our focus is on decision support: data, tools, and guidance for practitioners, 
planners, policymakers, and Indigenous knowledge-holders.
