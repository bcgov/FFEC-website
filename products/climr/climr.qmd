`climr` is an experimental R package that builds on the downscaling
concepts operationalized in the ClimateNA tool (Wang et al. 2016). It
provides downscaling of observational and simulated climate data using a
simple method that adds low-spatial-resolution climate anomalies to a
high-spatial-resolution reference climatological map, with additional
elevation adjustment. `climr` is developed and maintained in-house by
the FFEC.
