Climate Change Informed Species Selection (CCISS – pronounced ‘kiss’) is a 
Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification-based analysis framework built to 
anticipate the change climate implications to tree species environmental 
suitability at a site specific level. The CCISS tool is a web-based application 
that makes this analysis accessible to practitioners to help guide climate change
adaptation in reforestation decisions.
