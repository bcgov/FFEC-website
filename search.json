We are a scientific team that forecasts climate change impacts to BC’s forest ecosystems.\nOur focus is on decision support: data, tools, and guidance for practitioners, planners, policymakers, and Indigenous knowledge-holders."

    "text": "The Future Forest Ecosystems Centre is a brand new research-oriented team at the Forest Carbon and Climate Services Branch of the Office of the Chief Forester (BC Ministry of Forests).\nStarted in 2022, the FFEC has put together a team of researchers to answer complex questions about the stability and resilience for British Columbia’s forests to the effects of ongoing climate change, drought, pests and fire.\nTo answer these complex questions, we use a using a variety of approaches from advanced statistical modelling to downscale climate projections and complex ecological landscape simulation modelling, to collecting and analysing dendrochronological data to investigate tree and stand responses to climate warming and drought."
