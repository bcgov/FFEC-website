She has experience using complex ecological simulation models to explore fundamental and applied questions related to ecosystem stability to climate change, drought, fire, land-use changes and permafrost thaw. Her research is also strongly focused on the development of integrated, reusable and transparent modelling workflows that can be used not only for research purposes, but also to support and inform end-users within and beyond government. She earned her BSc in Biology from the University of Lisbon, Portugal, and an MSc in Ecology and Environmental Sustainability from the University of Aberdeen, Scotland. She later obtained her PhD in Biodiversity, Ecology and Environment from the University of Grenoble Alps, France, was a post-doctoral fellow and research associate at the Ceres is currently on the British Ecological Society Macroecology SIG committee and on the Response Diversity Network committee, and is an Associate Editor for Ecological Solutions and Evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKiri Daust\n\n\n\n\nKiri Daust, BSc - Data Scientist\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVanessa Comeau\n\n\n\n\nVanessa Comeau, MSc - Research EcologistVanessa Comeau uses forest ecology and dendrochronology to better understand the impacts of anthropogenic climate change on forests in British Columbia. She is particularly interested in applied research that is collaborative with local stakeholders and Indigenous Peoples. Vanessa earned an MSc from the Faculty of Forestry at the University of British Columbia focused on understanding the climatic drivers of yellow-cedar decline on Haida Gwaii. She completed a Bachelor of Environmental Science at the University of Manitoba with a focus on vegetation ecology and anthropogenic impacts on prairie ecosystems. Vanessa grew up in Winnipeg, Manitoba and has lived in BC since 2016. She currently lives and works on the unceded ancestral territory of the Musqueam, Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh peoples (Vancouver, BC).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVivek Srivastava\n\n\n\n\nDr Vivek Srivastava - Data Scientist Vivek is a PhD graduate from the University of British Columbia and is currently working with the BC Ministry of Forests as a Forest Health Research Climatologist. He is also an Honorary Research Associate at the University of British Columbia. He holds a bachelor’s degree in forestry, a master’s degree in remote sensing and GIS and a Ph.D. in Forest Ecology and Integrated Pest Management with specialization in forest health, ecological modelling, data analysis, GIS and applied machine learning. Vivek studies forest insect pests and develops computer-based spatial- temporal pest risk mathematical models to help detect and mitigate the spread of plant pests and diseases. His work also includes building data pipelines to understand, predict, and manage forest health factors, using existing forest health datasets and new technologies. He supervises multiple projects and students and actively presents his work on various scientific platforms. Vivek has received multiple academic and scientific awards and has published over a dozen peer-reviewed papers and is an Associate Editor for Management of Biological Invasions Vivek is excited about helping with efforts to proactively manage key insect pests while developing tools and techniques for assisting decision-making in managing natural resources."
