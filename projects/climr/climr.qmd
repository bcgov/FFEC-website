`climr` is an experimental R package that builds on the downscaling
concepts operationalized in the ClimateNA tool (Wang et al. 2016). It
provides downscaling of observational and simulated climate data using a
simple method that adds low-spatial-resolution climate anomalies to a
high-spatial-resolution reference climatological map, with additional
elevation adjustment. `climr` is developed and maintained in-house by
the FFEC.

`climr` addresses several unmet needs for climate analysis:

-   Efficient programmatic access to climate data (25-50x faster than
ClimateBC/NA)

-   Time series and normals for multiple climate simulations per GCM, which
is essential to representing interannual variability and the full range
of modeling uncertainty.

-   Open-source community development, providing data security and the
opportunity for BC government and public users to nimbly make
improvements.
