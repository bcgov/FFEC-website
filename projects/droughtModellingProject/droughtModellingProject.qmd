Drought severity and impacts on BC forests are expected to increase in
the coming years, with negative outcomes for an array of forest values
and ecosystem services (ES). Despite the existing evidence of drought
impacts across many forests in BC, forest management requires
assessments of forest susceptibility to both direct and indirect (e.g.
via changes in fire activity) drought effects across large spatial
scales and that account for climate uncertainty. These assessments are
only possible using modelling tools that incorporate information on
forest responses to drought and climate warming, but also the
interactions between drought, fire and the forest.

In collaboration with Dr. Ignacio Barbeito (UBC) and Dr. Ceres Barros
(CFS), the FFEC is supporting the development of new models to forecast
drought impacts on forest dynamics and forest ES in BC and fill current
forest modelling gaps within the context of forest management in BC.
Notably, the lack of spatially explicit simulation of disturbances
(e.g., wildfire), climate change and drought effects on forest dynamics,
which hinder our estimates of forest productivity and of annual
allowable cut under a changing climate and disturbance. The project will
capitalise on an existing open-source forest landscape model, LandR
(Barros et al. 2023), to forecast impacts of (gradual) climate warming,
drought and fire under different management approaches on timber and
non-timber ES in BC. LandR has been built with the principles of
reusability and transparency in mind, so that it can be more readily
transferred to different forests across BC.
